# MAKE-THINGS-INTERACTIVE
Arduino Project

GrumpyPot is a plant monitoring system that reminds
human carers to water their client friend. It monitors
soil moisture levels and sends audio warnings when
the moisture level is critical. The LED matrix utilizes
anthropomorphic graphics to personify the plant
- allowing the non-human user to express their
emotions.
The project aims to create bonds between humans
and plants to facilitate better plant care. The focus
on universal negative emotions hopes to let human
stakeholders empathize with the plant.
INPUT: moisture sensor, switch button
OUTPUT: LED matrix (animation), buzzer music
